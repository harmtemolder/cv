## ![about me icon](images/dialog.svg "About Me"){:class="icon"} About Me

I’m lazy. I don’t like doing the same thing twice. And I don’t like you doing the same thing twice either, if I can automate it instead. I’ll make sure that what I deliver is future-proof. You’ll be able to use it, even when I’m not around. I’m creative, but not in the painting and sculpturing kind of way. I’ll answer your challenges with solutions no-one in your organization thought of before. I’m a boy scout. Not that I walk around with a compass and a tinderbox, but **I’ll leave every implementation I touch looking better than it did when I first saw it**{:class="extra-strong"}. Making sense of incomprehensible configurations and cleaning up dirty code is what makes me get up in the morning. That, and good coffee. Great coffee is even better. Speaking of, let’s talk over coffee and Jitsi/Teams/Meet/Zoom*?

_* I don’t live anywhere, at the moment. Depending on when you’re reading this I’m exploring Chile’s Atacama desert in a camper van or in a cafe, back in civilization. No worries though, I have my laptop with me and there’s 4G everywhere, these days._

## ![projects ive enjoyed most icon](images/love.svg "Projects I’ve enjoyed most"){:class="icon"} Projects I’ve enjoyed most

As Data Engineer at ABN AMRO I was part of a scrum team of five (PO, SM, 2 front-end developers and myself). Together, we made sense of years of legacy implementations of web analytics, marketing pixels, an ancient cookie consent popup and more, spread out over countless codebases. The **1st** challenge was getting all of ABN’s web analysts to align on what they wanted to track on all of these environments. The **2nd** was adding scripts to existing systems, some of which weren’t actively maintained anymore. The **3rd** was keeping everything online while doing all of this, breaking as little as possible. And the **4th** was staying flexible to adjust our plans to new insights that kept popping up. [That boyscout principle I talked about](#about-me) fully applies to this project. **It was a mess before I started, but we left behind a Tealium iQ setup and a data environment that ABN AMRO can finally rely on, for years to come**{:class="extra-strong"}.

As Senior Analytics Consultant at Expand Online I was either the leading consultant involved with major new implementations, or the only one. As such, **I helped [Randstad](https://www.randstad.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Rituals](https://www.rituals.com/){:target="_blank"} and [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/){:target="_blank"} move from either a basic Google Analytics implementation or a non-Google analytics tool to Google Analytics 360**{:class="extra-strong"}. Depending on Google’s differing involvement per project I was completely responsible for, or at least involved in, formulating a measurement plan and subsequently implementing that in Google Tag Manager (or Tealium iQ, in the case of TomTom). After finishing the implementation phase, I supported the organizations’ web analysts in setting up Google Data Studio, Google BigQuery and other third-party data analysis and visualization tools. I also advised the organizations’ marketers on how to use all these new insights for their advertising campaigns. TomTom then asked me to set up Tealium AudienceStream (their Customer Data Platform, or "CDP"), which enabled them to personalize their website, advertising and email in real-time based on user data and interactions.

## ![experience &amp; education icon](images/floppy-disk.svg "Experience &amp; Education"){:class="icon"} Experience &amp; Education

**2017/03–Today** | **Freelance Analytics Engineer.**{:class="extra-strong"} I left Expand Online to travel the world on my motorbike, but took my laptop with me. That meant I could keep on helping both Dutch and global companies sort out their web analytics and data challenges from the road. I returned to the Netherlands at the end of 2018, enabling me to work on-site for a bit, but now I’m travelling again. And working from the road again.

**2019/04–2019/10** | **Data Engineer a.i. @ ABN AMRO, Amsterdam.**{:class="extra-strong"} They asked me to migrate their existing Adobe Analytics and DoubleClick setup to Tealium iQ, but we ended up completely re-doing both of those (and more) because they turned out to be [spaghetti layer cakes](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spaghetti+layer+cake&ia=images&iax=images){:target="_blank"} of legacy. Lots of fun, really. I’ve worked for e-commerce, publishers, recruitment agencies and more, but this was my first bank. And if you’ve ever worked for one, you know that they’re special. If you haven’t, ask me about this when you [contact me](#contact-information).

**2011/03–2017/02** | **Analytics Consultant @ Expand Online, Rotterdam.**{:class="extra-strong"} I started off as an SEO intern but became Expand Online’s first Analytics Consultant in a team that quickly grew—8 by the time I left. I helped Expand Online’s e-commerce, recruitment and b2b clients come up with their web analytics strategies, shaped those into measurement plans, guided their developers through the implementations (or do these myself through tag management tools), and finally helped them make sense of the results either in recurring reports and dashboards or through one-off analyses.

**2012/02–2013/01** | **M.Sc. Persuasive Communication @ University of Amsterdam.** Although "Persuasive Communication" sounds fancier, just think of this as a **master’s degree in marketing communications**{:class="extra-strong"}.
