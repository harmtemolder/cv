I'm lazy. I don't like doing the same thing twice. And I don't like you to do the same thing twice if I can automate it instead. I'll make sure that what I deliver is future-proof. You'll be able to use it, even when I'm not around. I'm creative, but not in the painting and sculpturing kind of way. I'll answer your challenges with solutions no-one in your organisation thought of before. I'm a boy scout. Not that I walk around with a compass and a tinderbox, but I'll leave every implementation I touch looking better than it did when I first saw it. Making sense of incomprehensible configurations and cleaning up dirty code is what makes me get up in the morning. That, and good coffee. Great coffee is even better. Speaking of, why don't you invite me for a cup?

**03/2017 - Today** | **Freelance Analytics Consultant.** I left Expand Online to travel the world on my motorbike, but I took my laptop with me. That meant I could keep on helping both Dutch and global companies sort out their web analytics and data challenges from the road. After having returned to the Netherlands at the end of 2018, I'm now available to meet you in person and get your data needs taken care of as well. Just call me at [+31 (0) 6 426 966 16](tel:+31642696616 "Harm's Phone Number").
**03/2011 - 02/2017** | **Analytics Consultant @ Expand Online, Rotterdam.** I started off as an SEO intern but became Expand Online’s first Analytics Consultant in a team that quickly grew to 8 at the time I left. I helped Expand Online's e-commerce, recruitment and b2b clients come up with their web analytics strategies, shaped those into a measurement plan, guided their developers through the implementations (or do these myself through tag management tools), and finally helped them make sense of the results either in recurring reports and dashboards or through one-off analyses.
**02/2012 - 01/2013** | **MSc. Persuasive Communication @ University of Amsterdam.** Although "Persuasive Communication" sounds fancier, just think of it as a master’s degree in marketing communications.
