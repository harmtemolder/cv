I'm lazy. I don't like doing the same thing twice. And I don't like you to do the same thing twice if I can automate it instead. I'll make sure that what I deliver is future-proof. You'll be able to use it, even when I'm not around. I'm creative, but not in the painting and sculpturing kind of way. I'll answer your challenges with solutions no-one in your organisation thought of before. I'm a boy scout. Not that I walk around with a compass and a tinderbox, but <strong class="extra-strong">I'll leave every implementation I touch looking better than it did when I first saw it</strong>. Making sense of incomprehensible configurations and cleaning up dirty code is what makes me get up in the morning. That, and good coffee. Great coffee is even better. Speaking of, why don't you invite me for a cup?

As Senior Analytics Consultant at Expand Online (see [Experience & Education](#experience--education)) I was either the leading consultant involved with major new implementations, or the only one. As such, <strong class="extra-strong">I helped [Randstad](https://www.randstad.com/), [Rituals](https://www.rituals.com/) and [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/) move from either a basic Google Analytics implementation or a non-Google analytics tool to Google Analytics 360</strong>. Depending on Google's differing involvement per project I was completely responsible for, or at least involved in, formulating a measurement plan and subsequently implementing that in Google Tag Manager (or the Tealium iQ tag manager, in the case of TomTom). After finishing the implementation phase, I supported the organisations' web analysts in setting up Google Data Studio, Google BigQuery and other third-party data analysis and visualisation tools. I also advised the organisations' marketers on how to use all these new insights for their advertising campaigns. TomTom even asked me to set up their DMP (Tealium AudienceStream) for them, which enabled them to personalise their website, advertising and email in real-time based on user data and interactions.

One of [Sdu](https://www.sdu.nl/)'s services is a platform for local governments on which these governments supply all kinds of information to their citizens (e.g. [Hulpwijzer Den Helder](https://www.hulpwijzerdenhelder.nl/)). There are about 30 of these platforms live and several more to be delivered soon. The problem was that neither Sdu, nor the respective local governments knew what really happened on these platforms. Some of them contained a basic implementation of Google Analytics, but most didn't. <strong class="extra-strong">Sdu asked me to provide them with the means to answer their own and their customers' questions</strong>. After a full-scale inventory of the current situation, in which I even found a couple of live platforms Sdu didn't know about, I could advise Sdu on how things needed to change for them to be able to get the answers they wanted from Google Analytics. We moved to a single Google Tag Manager container that I future-proofed for easy implementation on new platforms. This container includes Google Analytics with custom dimensions and metrics and event tracking. What I enjoyed most in this project was the making sense of a situation where no-one really knew what was going on and providing them with that knowledge.

**03/2017 - Today** | <strong class="extra-strong">Freelance Analytics Consultant.</strong> I left Expand Online to travel the world on my motorbike, but I took my laptop with me. That meant I could keep on helping both Dutch and global companies sort out their web analytics and data challenges from the road. After having returned to the Netherlands at the end of 2018, I'm now available to meet you in person and get your data needs taken care of as well. Just call me at [+31 (0) 6 426 966 16](tel:+31642696616 "Harm's Phone Number").
**03/2011 - 02/2017** | <strong class="extra-strong">Analytics Consultant @ Expand Online, Rotterdam.</strong> I started off as an SEO intern but became Expand Online’s first Analytics Consultant in a team that quickly grew to 8 at the time I left. I helped Expand Online's e-commerce, recruitment and b2b clients come up with their web analytics strategies, shaped those into a measurement plan, guided their developers through the implementations (or do these myself through tag management tools), and finally helped them make sense of the results either in recurring reports and dashboards or through one-off analyses.
**02/2012 - 01/2013** | <strong>MSc. Persuasive Communication @ University of Amsterdam.</strong> Although "Persuasive Communication" sounds fancier, just think of it as a <strong class="extra-strong">master’s degree in marketing communications</strong>.
